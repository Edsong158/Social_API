# Social Network API

This project is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The API is built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database, and Mongoose as the ODM.

- **User Management**: Users can create an account, log in, update their profile information, and delete their account.
- **Thoughts**: Users can create, read, update, and delete their thoughts.
- **Reactions**: Users can react to thoughts (e.g., like, dislike, etc.).
- **Friendship**: Users can add and remove friends from their friend list.
